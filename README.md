# RoadMap

The object of the SimpleNFT project is to be the basis for running your own NFT. This should be all encompassing. Which means it should include: the Contract, the DApp, Deploying and Testing.

This roadmap will keep growing and evolving as the NFTs and the industry as a whole keeps evolving.

Why? Let's take for example the need for Gas considerations, depending on the implementation of ETH 2.0, gas considerations might not be such a major factor. Going from pontentially saying $s to savings ¢s. So maybe we end up simplifying the contract to be more readable rather than gas efficient. Time will tell.

## 1.0

1. Build the ERC721 Smart Contract
1. Integrate HardHat
1. Contract testing
1. Contract deploying
1. Integrate ethers.js / web3.js
1. Build Minting DApp
1. Deploy Minting Dapp

More coming soon...
